Her symptoms had begun the previous night with shortness of breath. She sought treatment because of the persistent and progressive nature of the symptoms. A chest radiograph was obtained and showed a large left-sided pneumothorax. She was transferred to the emergency department, where she underwent placement of a thoracostomy tube. She reported receiving a diagnosis of a “congenital lung abnormality” several years earlier. Because the nature of the underlying lung abnormality was not clear from the patient history, repeat radiography and computed tomography (CT) were performed after thoracostomy drainage.\n\n# Imaging Findings\n\nChest radiography performed after thoracostomy drainage showed a focal tubular area of increased opacity in the left upper lobe and a small residual pneumothorax (Fig 1). Contrast material–enhanced CT of the chest was performed to further characterize the radiographic findings. Interval reexpansion of the left lung and a decrease in size of the pneumothorax were seen. A 3.3 × 1.5-cm nonenhancing tubular mass was seen extending cephalad from the left hilum, with surrounding hypoattenuation of the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe, a finding indicative of hyperinflation (Fig 2).\n\nFigure 1. Radiograph shows a branching tubular area of increased opacity (arrow), which represents a bronchocele and extends from the left hilum into the left upper lobe. A thoracostomy tube was placed to treat a left-sided pneumothorax.\n\nRadioGraphics 2009;29:1531–1535 • Published online 10.1148/rg.295085239 • Content Code:\n\n1From the Departments of Radiology (M.G.G., K.W.C.) and Pathology (K.M.H.), Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, 510 S Kingshighway Blvd, St Louis, MO 63110.
