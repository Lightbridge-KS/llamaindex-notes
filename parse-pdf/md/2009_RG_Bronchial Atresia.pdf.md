# History

A 22-year-old woman presented to the student health clinic with acute, sharp, left-sided chest pain that worsened with deep inspiration. Her symptoms had begun the previous night with shortness of breath. She sought treatment because of the persistent and progressive nature of the symptoms. A chest radiograph was obtained and showed a large left-sided pneumothorax. She was transferred to the emergency department, where she underwent placement of a thoracostomy tube. She reported receiving a diagnosis of a “congenital lung abnormality” several years earlier. Because the nature of the underlying lung abnormality was not clear from the patient history, repeat radiography and computed tomography (CT) were performed after thoracostomy drainage.

# Imaging Findings

Chest radiography performed after thoracostomy drainage showed a focal tubular area of increased opacity in the left upper lobe and a small residual pneumothorax (Fig 1). Contrast material–enhanced CT of the chest was performed to further characterize the radiographic findings. Interval reexpansion of the left lung and a decrease in size of the pneumothorax were seen. A 3.3 × 1.5-cm nonenhancing tubular mass was seen extending cephalad from the left hilum, with surrounding hypoattenuation of the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe, a finding indicative of hyperinflation (Fig 2).

Figure 1. Radiograph shows a branching tubular area of increased opacity (arrow), which represents a bronchocele and extends from the left hilum into the left upper lobe. A thoracostomy tube was placed to treat a left-sided pneumothorax.

# Figure 2.

Axial soft-tissue window (a), axial lung window (b), and minimum-intensity-projection lung window coronal (c) and sagittal (d) contrast-enhanced CT images show a tubular nonenhancing lesion (arrow), a finding consistent with mucus impaction of the apicoposterior left-upper-lobe bronchus (bronchocele). Decreased attenuation is seen throughout the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe in b–d, a finding indicative of associated air trapping. These CT features are diagnostic of bronchial atresia. Note the small residual pneumothorax (* in c).

(a) Inspiratory radiograph obtained 2 years earlier shows a bronchocele in the left upper lobe (arrow). (b) Exhalation radiograph shows an area of hyperlucency (*) surrounding the area of increased opacity, a finding indicative of air trapping.

Photograph of the left upper lobectomy specimen shows a large bronchocele. The mucus plug was removed. Signs of hyperinflation are seen in the surrounding lung parenchyma (arrowheads). Arrow = bronchial resection margin.

# Figure 5

(a) Photomicrograph (original magnification, ×4; inset magnification, ×20; hematoxylin-eosin stain) shows respiratory bronchioles that are plugged with mucus (arrows) and surrounded by dilated alveoli. Inset shows a bronchiole lined with respiratory epithelium and filled with mucus, macrophages, and sparse neutrophils. Clefting within the mucoid debris is prominent and is secondary to dissolution of cholesterol and lipids.

(b) Photomicrograph (original magnification, ×20; hematoxylin-eosin stain) shows alveolar dilatation. The septa are thin, fine, and nonfibrosed and interconnect with one another. There are no hyaline membranes present, and no significant inflammatory infiltrate is seen. This pattern is indicative of hyperinflation rather than destruction.

Earlier radiographs, including inspiratory and expiratory views, were acquired from an outside institution for comparison. They showed a tubular area of increased opacity that extended from the left hilum into the left upper lobe (Fig 3). On the expiratory view, there was persistent hyperinflation of the left upper lobe around the area of increased opacity.

Pathologic Evaluation

The patient initially was treated conservatively with chest tube placement, which resulted in prompt reexpansion of the lung. However, she developed a persistent pneumothorax secondary to a residual air leak, and the decision was made to perform a lingula-sparing left-upper-lobe segmentectomy. A soft pliable mass, which represented a mucocele, was palpated intraoperatively.

Microscopic analysis of the resected lung revealed airways plugged by mucus and prominent alveolar distention (Fig 5). Alveoli were enlarged and appeared intact, with minimal surrounding lung parenchyma that was brown-tan and grossly unremarkable.
